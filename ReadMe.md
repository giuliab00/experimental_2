Assignment 2 of Experimental Robotics Laboratory
================================================

The goal of this assignment is to work with a rosbot ...

How to download
----------------------

In order to run the solution it is necessary to have the following ROS package:

```bash
git clone 
```

Lastly you can finally download our package. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/giuliab00/experimental_1
```


SIMULATION 
------------------------------------

### How to run the solution

If you have followed the previous steps, it is possible to start the simulation using the following commands:

```bash
roslaunch experimental_2 sim_aruco2.launch
```
this will open the simulation environmente
```bash
roslaunch experimental_2 rosbot.launch
```
while this tutti sticazzi

### PDDL
che abbiamo usato bla bla e breve descrizione


### Architecture and Pseudocode

In order to achieve the solution it has been thought of the following architecture:


#### DetectMarkerInterface Node
This node

```cpp


```
####  GoToInterface Node
This node
```    cpp

```
#### MoveToInterface Node
This node
```    cpp

```
#### markerDetector Node
This node
```    cpp

```
#### planLauncher Node
This node
```    cpp

```
#### findMarkerAction Node
This node
```    cpp

```

### Video
Here it is possible to find the video showing the behaviour in the simulation


ROSBOT REAL LIFE
------------------------------------
### CHE MINCHIA ABBIAMO CAMBIATO


### How to run the solution

It will be only needed (by sharing the roscore with the rosbot)

```bash
roslaunch experimental_2 rosbot.launch
```

### Video
Here it is possible to find the video showing the behaviour in the lab

Drawback and Possible improvements
-------------------------
There are different improvement regarding both the simulation and the real rosbot.
